# ClientManager

Client Manager Application

This Client Manager is A simple but powerful Application.

For this application I utilized various technologies mostly following the MERN Stack.

For the front end of this application I used React JS to construct the client side view. And used the CSS Framework Semantic UI to style The Components. 

For the Back End of this appliction I created the database and schemas using the MongoDB ORM Mongoose, along with node and express to create the server. I added authentication to protect api routes using Passport JS. 

For the future I would like to add features that let you create appointments, Have a Profile that displays your information, and let users add other users contact info to their client list.
